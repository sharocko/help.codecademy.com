In Q&A Forums, you can ask questions about specific exercises. Each exercise section is linked to its own Q&A Forum.

In Groups, you can ask for advice, share your projects, build projects with others, or talk about programming practices. You can find groups based on languages, interests, skills, or simply for fun. [Browse Groups](http://www.codecademy.com/groups)
