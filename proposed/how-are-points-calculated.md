title: How are points calculated?
---
You will earn one point per exercise on Codecademy; if you complete 10 exercises, then you will receive 10 points. The 'points today' tally shows all the points you've earned in one day, based on your local timezone.

In addition, as you earn points, you will be awarded Exercise Badges, which will show up on the Achievements page of your User Profile. Presently, they come in seven denominations, as shown below.

The "December 29, 2013" will be the actual date you earned the badge.

The observant student will note that after 1,000 points, there are no higher denominations. That's because once you get to that high number of points, you are obviously quite determined and self-motivated! We at Codecademy are proud of your accomplishment! Every point after 1,000 will surely be award enough!
