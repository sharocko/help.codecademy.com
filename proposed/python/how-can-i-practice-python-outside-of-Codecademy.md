title: How can I practice Python outside of Codecademy?
---
There are two ways you can practice Python outside of the Codecademy lessons. 

  1. You can use [Codecademy Labs][1], our online editor and interpreter. It works in offline mode as long as it is preloaded.
  2. You can setup your local development environment. First, you will need to [install Python][2] on your local system. Once it is installed, you can either practice in the interpreter or practice by writing script files. See the appropriate section below for more details.

#### Running the interpreter
Open a command prompt or terminal and type `python`. The interpreter should start and you can start writing Python code.

  - **Advantage**: You can see your code run live.
  - **Disadvantage**: Your code will not be saved.


#### Creating and running script files
To create a script file and run it, follow these steps:

  1. Open a [text editor][3] of your choice (Microsoft Word is not a text editor). 
  2. Write your script.
  3. Save your script with a `.py` extension.
  4. Open up a terminal or command prompt and locate your script.
  5. Type `python <your-script>.py` (Python2) or `python3 <your-script.py` (Python3) to run your script.

  - **Advantage**: Your code will be saved.
  - **Disadvantage**: You cannot see your code run live.
